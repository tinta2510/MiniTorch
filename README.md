# MiniTorch - Re-implement Torch from scratch
A minimalist, educational re-implementation of core Pytorch's components. This project is based on the [MiniTorch](https://github.com/minitorch/minitorch) public template and aims to understand the internals of automatic differentiation, tensor operations, and neural network operations.
